<h1>The Best Movies according to Tymothy Lim</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Spiderman 2</h3>
<p>In this movie, Peter Parker wrestles with having enough time for both his hero-duties as well as his personal needs (studies, work).
    He even gives up for a period. However, awhile later, out of all the struggle, he is encouraged by his Aunt May's words, as well as his neighbour's (a kid) hope to see more heros.
    I get encouraged because it reminds me that God sees the things I do / don't do, and acknowledges them in His way.

<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>The dynamic between the hobbits really shows that we are not designed to accomplish anything alone.
    God created us individuals to build one another up in love. That is the design in Christ.
</p>

<h3>The Book of Life</h3>
<p>This animated movie features 2 young men, striving for the affections of a lady.
    One is gifted musical talent. The other, physical strength to best his foes.
    While the actual conclusion was not particularly memorable for me, I did resonate with
    the sense of mourning the first guy went through. This guy was born into a bullfighter family, but
    took pity on the killed bulls. He was ostrasized for "bring shame" to his bullfighter family on his
    debut fight against a bull: at the last moment to strike the killing blow, he relented. Afterwards, he
    expressed his grief and loneliness through song (a song I actually find a bit vulgar, but somehow resonated with (at least the emotions of it)).
